# Professional. Performant. Perfect.


This is the the type of development we're after. Whether you're a potential client or just looking, I guarentee you won't be dissapointed.

## About Me
I'm a highly accomplished software engineer with a passion for doing software things. My passion started early, when I used the then-popular browser Netscape in first grade and thought to myself, "Man, I want to make websites someday!" Ever since, I've been passionate about creating beautiful, informative webpages.

## Experience
I've built websites for a variety of well-known companies, some of whose logos are listed below. Note that none of these places are real.
